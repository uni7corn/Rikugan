# Iris — The IDA Pro companion

An IDA Pro plugin that integrates a multi-provider LLM agent as a first-class reverse engineering companion. Iris provides an agentic loop with streaming, 57 purpose-built IDA tools, 7 built-in analysis skills, MCP client, and a native Qt chat panel, all accessible through a single hotkey.

This project was done together with my friend, Claude code.


## Is this another MCP client?

No, Iris is an agent built to live inside IDA Pro. It does not consume an MCP server to interact with IDA, it has its own agentic loop, context management, and tool orchestration layer running entirely in-process. 

The agent loop is a generator-based turn cycle: each user message kicks off a stream->execute->repeat pipeline where the LLM response is streamed token-by-token, tool calls are intercepted and dispatched. 

The results are fed back as the next turn's context. It supports automatic error recovery, mid-run user questions, plan mode for multi-step workflows, and message queuing, all without leaving IDA.

The agent really ***lives*** and ***breath*** reversing.

Advantages:

- No need to switch to an external MCP client such as Claude Code
- Assistant first, not made to do your job (unless you ask it)
- Expandable to many LLM providers and local installations (Ollama)
- Quick enabling, just hit Ctrl+Shift+I and the chat will appear

Also, building agents is an amazing area of study, especially coding with them.


## Features

- **57 IDA tools** — navigation, decompiler, disassembly, xrefs, strings, annotations, type engineering, microcode, scripting
- **7 built-in skills** — malware analysis, deobfuscation, vulnerability audit, driver analysis, CTF solving, and more
- **MCP client** — connect external MCP servers, their tools appear alongside built-in ones
- **9 context menu actions** — right-click in disasm/pseudocode for instant analysis
- **5 LLM providers** — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible
- **Message queuing** — send follow-up messages while the agent is working; they auto-submit when the current turn finishes
- **Microcode tools** — read, NOP, and install custom optimizers at any Hex-Rays maturity level
- **Session persistence** — auto-save/restore conversations across IDA restarts

## Requirements

- IDA Pro 9.0+ with Hex-Rays decompiler (recommended)
- Python 3.9+ (3.14 is known to have problems with Qt)
- At least one LLM provider


## Installation

Clone this repository, then run the installer for your platform:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./install.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bat
install.bat
```

Both scripts auto-detect your IDA user directory. If detection fails (or you have a non-standard setup), pass the path explicitly:

```bash
./install.sh /path/to/ida/user/dir
install.bat "C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro"
```

The installer symlinks the plugin into your IDA plugins folder, installs pip dependencies, and creates the Iris config directory.

### Set your API key

Iris has a settings dialog to configure your model of choice; it comes with predefined values. Open Iris → click Settings → paste your key. Keys are persisted to `~/.idapro/iris/config.json`.

**Anthropic OAuth:** If you have Claude Code installed and authenticated, Iris auto-detects the OAuth token from the macOS Keychain. Otherwise, you can get the OAuth token by running `claude setup-token` (you'll have to log in again).



## Usage

### Open the panel

Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** or go to **Edit → Plugins → Iris**.

![Panel overview](assets/panel.png)


Type a message and press **Enter** to send. Iris streams the response and executes IDA tools as needed.

- **Enter** — send message
- **Shift+Enter** — newline
- **Escape** — cancel the current run (also clears queued messages)

### Message queuing

You can send messages while the agent is working. They appear as `[queued]` in the chat and auto-submit when the current turn finishes. Hit **Stop** to cancel the running turn and discard all queued messages.

### Context menu

Right-click in the disassembly or pseudocode view:

| Action | Views | Behavior |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Send to IRIS** | disasm, pseudo | Pre-fills input with selection (Ctrl+Shift+A) |
| **Explain this** | disasm, pseudo | Auto-explains the current function |
| **Rename with IRIS** | disasm, pseudo | Analyzes and renames with evidence |
| **Deobfuscate with IRIS** | disasm, pseudo | Systematic deobfuscation |
| **Find vulnerabilities** | disasm, pseudo | Security audit |
| **Suggest types** | disasm, pseudo | Infers types from usage patterns |
| **Annotate function** | pseudo | Adds comments to decompiled code |
| **Clean microcode** | pseudo | Identifies and NOPs junk microcode |
| **Xref analysis** | disasm, pseudo | Deep cross-reference tracing |

### Skills

Skills are reusable analysis workflows. Type `/` in the input area to see available skills with autocomplete.

**Built-in skills:**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/malware-analysis` | Windows PE malware — kill chain, IOC extraction, MITRE ATT&CK mapping |
| `/linux-malware` | ELF malware — packing detection, persistence, IOC extraction |
| `/deobfuscation` | String decryption, CFF removal, opaque predicates, MBA simplification, microcode cleaning |
| `/driver-analysis` | Windows kernel drivers — DriverEntry, dispatch table, IOCTL handlers |
| `/vuln-audit` | Buffer overflows, format strings, integer issues, memory safety |
| `/ctf` | Capture-the-flag — find the flag efficiently |
| `/generic-re` | General-purpose binary analysis |

**User skills:** Create custom skills in `~/.iris/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. User skills with the same slug override built-in ones.

### MCP Servers

Connect external MCP servers to extend Iris with additional tools. Configure in `~/.iris/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "binary-ninja": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "binaryninja_mcp"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tools appear alongside built-in tools with the prefix `mcp_<server>_<tool>`. The agent sees them in the tool list and can call them like any other tool.

## Tools

57 tools organized by category:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Navigation** | `get_cursor_position`, `get_current_function`, `jump_to`, `get_name_at`, `get_address_of` |
| **Functions** | `list_functions`, `get_function_info`, `search_functions` |
| **Strings** | `list_strings`, `search_strings`, `get_string_at` |
| **Database** | `list_segments`, `list_imports`, `list_exports`, `get_binary_info`, `read_bytes` |
| **Disassembly** | `read_disassembly`, `read_function_disassembly`, `get_instruction_info` |
| **Decompiler** | `decompile_function`, `get_pseudocode`, `get_decompiler_variables` |
| **Xrefs** | `xrefs_to`, `xrefs_from`, `function_xrefs` |
| **Annotations** | `rename_function`, `rename_variable`, `set_comment`, `set_function_comment`, `rename_address`, `set_type` |
| **Types** | `create_struct`, `modify_struct`, `get_struct_info`, `list_structs`, `create_enum`, `modify_enum`, `get_enum_info`, `list_enums`, `create_typedef`, `apply_struct_to_address`, `apply_type_to_variable`, `set_function_prototype`, `import_c_header`, `suggest_struct_from_accesses`, `propagate_type`, `get_type_libraries`, `import_type_from_library` |
| **Microcode** | `get_microcode`, `get_microcode_block`, `nop_microcode`, `install_microcode_optimizer`, `remove_microcode_optimizer`, `list_microcode_optimizers`, `redecompile_function` |
| **Scripting** | `execute_python` (last resort — the agent prefers built-in tools) |

Decompiler and microcode tools require Hex-Rays. If unavailable, they return an error and all other tools continue to work.
